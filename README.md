# Flu-Shot-Learning

## Background and Challenge

Public health measures, particularly vaccination, play a pivotal role in combating infectious diseases. Vaccination not only confers immunity to individuals but also contributes to the broader "herd immunity," essential for reducing disease spread within communities.

This project is inspired by the response to the H1N1 influenza pandemic, also known as "swine flu," which emerged in the spring of 2009. The pandemic highlighted the global challenge of responding to infectious disease outbreaks, with the H1N1 virus causing an estimated 151,000 to 575,000 deaths worldwide in its first year alone.

By October 2009, a vaccine against the H1N1 flu virus was made available to the public. The United States' National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey, conducted in late 2009 and early 2010, forms the basis of our dataset. This phone survey collected data on whether respondents received the H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccines, alongside questions about their demographics, opinions on vaccine efficacy and illness risks, and behaviors related to transmission mitigation.

Understanding the relationships between these characteristics and vaccination behavior can provide invaluable insights for future public health initiatives. As the world faces new health challenges, including the development of vaccines for emerging diseases like COVID-19, lessons learned from past pandemics remain highly relevant.

## Objective

The primary goal of this challenge is to predict individuals' H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccination status based on information shared about their backgrounds, opinions, and health behaviors. By leveraging machine learning models to analyze the survey data, we aim to uncover patterns and factors that influence vaccination decisions. These insights could guide public health strategies to enhance vaccine uptake and manage disease spread effectively.

## Data Source

The dataset for this challenge comes from DrivenData's "Flu Shot Learning" practice competition, which revisits the public health response to the H1N1 pandemic using data from the National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey.
